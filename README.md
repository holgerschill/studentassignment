# Algorithmic problem

Moles have infested a 16x16 area.
The fences of your gardens are outlined on maps with |, + and - symbols.
The mole hills are represented by a lower-case o.
How many mole hills are in your gardens?

- Two parallel fences of the garden cannot touch (it wouldn't make sense).
- Garden space is filled with white space unless there is a mole hill. Other space is filled with dots unless there is a mole hill.
- Everything that touches the outside of the map and is not enclosed in fences is other space. A fence is always between garden space and other space.
- Mole hills cannot be on fences.

Input
16 lines of 16 symbols, representing the map of the area.

Output
An integer for the number of mole hills in your gardens.

Constraints
